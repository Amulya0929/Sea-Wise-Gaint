# Sea-Wise-Gaint
This project aims to build a machine learning model that to predict whether or not a passenger survived the sinking of the Seawise Giant (a synthetic, much larger dataset based on the actual Titanic dataset). For each PasengerId row in the test set, must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived target.
